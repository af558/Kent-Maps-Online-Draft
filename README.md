# The Summer of 1944 Kent

In the Summer of 1944 the Germans and Allies faced off across the English Channel, believing due to the close coastline and large port in the area the Germans were convinced that the invasion would occur from Dover to Calais. A fake invading army squadron was hosted there under a fake general, known as FUSAG (First United STates Army Group).1 Numerous fake rafts were built using scaffolding tubes, barrels, wood and canvas and these dummy landding craft were launched on the 5th Aug along with huge spikes in communications and radio messages. Known as Operation Fortitude South this was believed to be a hugely successful deception aiding the course of the D-Day invasion. This was not however the only part Kent had to play in the outcome of the war.

## 'Doodlebugs' -The V2 Rocket

 Thanks to new technological advancements and breakthroughs the Germans had recently developed a new weapon. The impact this new ‘revenge weapon’ (Vergeltungswaffen) used by the Germans towards the end of WW2: the V-1 flying bomb, also known as the doodlebug. Nicknamed because of its erratic movement and the buzzing noise which signalled its arrival overhead, the doodlebug was a jet engined flying bomb. The heavy bombing of Kent with 2,400 doodlebugs in the Summer of 1944 would lead to this period being known retrospectively as ‘Doodlebug Summer’.
 
       "I remember them very clearly. They made a sound like a lorry engine going very fast. They kept flying until they ran out of fuel. Then they simply fell to the ground and exploded. Whenever we heard a doodlebug everyone looked up and followed it with their eyes until it had gone over past where we were standing. If the engine stopped before it got to us that was the time to worry! Sometimes a doodlebug dropped to earth immediately and sometimes it would continue to glide, gradually losing height. Very scary!" - Peter Kitcherside

## Bomber's Alley
A map in ‘The Kent Messenger’ from the Summer of 1944 shows the extent of the bombing in the Kent Section of the South East of England, providing a visual explanation for the name ‘Bomb Alley’ that was given to Kent during the Blitz. Kent’s location on route to the more densely populated city of London, which was the Germans’ main target, meant that enemy bombers who ran out of fuel or were shot down before they reached London, as well as any bombs that fell short of their target, would fall on Kent instead.


## Further Subterfuge 
 It was believed that this situation was only worsened by the decisions made by the wartime leaders of Britain. The heavy shelling and intensive bombing on London ahd taken its toll however and the decimated city was far more densely populated than most of the country. The decision was then made torelease propaganda and encoded radio with the message that the bombs were overfueled, and due to this miscalculation most of them had overshot London with the payload. Unfortunately, it worked and many rockets once destined for the capital were landing in Kent, furthermore those shot down by countermeasures or even tipped over by allied pilots would crash down on kent. More sparsely populated than London certainly but it still cost many lives.

 ## Last of the bombs
 Though the decision to change the path of the bombs saved many lives in London, the ethics of the government’s decision to interfere with the destination of the bombs has been considered highly controversial. By the end of the war, doodlebugs had killed over 6,000 people in Britain, with the final doodlebug hitting Orpington on March 27th, 1945.  3
